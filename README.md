Hi,
I am a second-year computer science student at MFF UK in Prague. 
Besides studying, you could also find me consuming and producing music ( listening vs. playing ukulele or violin (depending on my mood)), taking photos on Sony Alpha, programming for fun ?? learning languages, volunteering, etc. I want to try other hobbies but I don't have time!!!
